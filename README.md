# CV
My first react project. Ended up being pretty bad sphagetti code, will likely restart the project once I have some extra time.

Short-term goals:
- (!) Clean up the css so that things are easier to navigate. Massive global.js file needs to be split up. After a lot of trial and error many classes also have some unneeded stuff in them which should be removed.
- Fix theme menu
- Add content
- Change default page title and icon
- Figure out how to make subpage transitions

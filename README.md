# CV
My personal CV/Portfolio and first React project.

Short-term goals:
- Fix front-page height so that it depends on window size. Re-render on resize.
- Clean up the css so that things are easier to navigate, maybe split in different files if possible.
- Take responsiveness further and add a hamburger menu with small screen sizes.
- Add content

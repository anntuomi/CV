# CV
My personal CV/Portfolio and first React project.

Short-term goals:
- (!) Clean up the css so that things are easier to navigate. Massive global.js file needs to be split up. After a lot of trial and error many classes also have some unneeded stuff in them which should be removed.
- Fix theme menu
- Add content
- Figure out how to make subpage transitions
